# Todo App using Clean architecture and TDD

## Description

This is a Flutter mobile application built with clean architecture and MVVM design pattern. It includes unit, widget, and integration tests and uses Provider for state management, Hive for local storage, and GetIt for dependency injection. The app has a CI/CD pipeline using Codemagic and code coverage is tracked with Codecov.

Provider

### Provider 
Provider is a state management solution for Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of managing application state by allowing you to create and update state objects in one central location, which can then be accessed by any part of your application.

### Hive

Hive is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-use NoSQL database for Flutter applications. It allows you to store and retrieve data from your local device with minimal setup and configuration.

### MVVM

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a design pattern that separates the user interface (View) from the application logic (ViewModel) and the data model (Model). This separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain and modify your codebase as your application grows.

### Clean Architecture

Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns and dependency inversion. It promotes modular and testable code by separating the business logic from the presentation layer and the data layer.

### Unit, Widget, and Integration Tests

Unit tests are automated tests that verify the behavior of individual functions or methods in isolation. Widget tests are used to test the behavior of UI components, while integration tests are used to test the interaction between different parts of the app.

### GetIt

GetIt is a simple yet powerful dependency injection (DI) framework for Flutter applications. It allows you to easily inject dependencies into your classes, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.

### Codemagic

Codemagic is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform designed specifically for Flutter applications. It provides a streamlined and automated process for building, testing, and deploying your app to various platforms.

### Codecov

Codecov is a code coverage tool that helps you track and improve the quality of your code. It provides detailed reports on the parts of your codebase that are covered by your tests, helping you identify areas that need more attention.
